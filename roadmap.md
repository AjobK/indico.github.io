> Some contributions from IEEE.*

### PoC/Sprints :runner:

* Indico as the missing piece in Groupware:
    - Improved home page with dashboard;
    - Layered view based on favourite categories/events;
    - "Stub events" with no date;
    - Easier event creation/invite workflow;
* [Webhooks for notifications](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/3944) (compatible with CERN Push Notifications);

## 2021

### Still to schedule
* UI Improvements and legacy code removal
    - React-based registration form + lightweight registrations
    - React-based timetable


## Help needed :bell:

We are trying as much as possible to find ways of solving these pending issues in due time. If you believe you could
 **help with any of those**, don't hesitate to [let us know](mailto:indico-team@cern.ch).

* [Tools to assist in GDPR compliance](https://github.com/indico/indico/issues/1415);

## Future :crystal_ball:

* User Interfaces
    - Responsive interfaces that work OK on mobile
    - Greater Accessibility (screenreaders, colourblind users, etc...)
