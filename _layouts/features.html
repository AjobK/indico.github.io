You will never need to bring with you to the meeting that USB drive room ever again, or mail yourself PPT files. Your participants will be able to easily find what is going on in the organisation and access the materials from anywhere.</p>

                        <p>Indico was built with a large organisation in mind (CERN). This is why events are organised in a hierarchy of categories and protection of resources can be defined at several granularity levels. From small schools to large enterprises, Indico is the intuitive solution for secure event storage.</p>

We believe in open collaborative platforms, and this is why we provide a simple and powerful REST API that allows for easy retrieval of information. The API is in constant expansion.
